## Directory structure

- Data are saved in the data folder
- Individual run results and their summary statistics can be obtained using scripts in the `scripts` folder
- Graphs for the manuscript and individual runs can be obtained using reports in the `reports` folder

## Requirements
The scripts require a custom package [here](https://github.com/hejtmy/fgu-avoidance) created to process, analyze and visualise data from the experimental box.
